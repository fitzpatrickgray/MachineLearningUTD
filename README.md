## Data Exploration
Basic statistical information calculation on two different vectros of information. See the [code](DataExploration/DataExploration.cpp), or if you want to see the [documentation](DataExploration/Document.md)

## Linear Models
### Linear Regression
Trained a linear regression model to fit accelerometer data of a fan. Three different configurations placed two weights on different fan blades, oscillations in X, Y, and Z directions were measured. Model would predict the magnitude of these oscillations given the configuration. See the [code](LinearModels/AccelerometerLinReg.Rmd) and [documentation](LinearModels/LinearRegression.pdf). Observations concluded that a fan with an imbalance in blade weight, particulary along an axis, will oscillate more.
### Classification
You can see my partner's work, Michael Stinnett in his [classification documentation](LinearModels/Classification.pdf). The dataset he used predicted income based on race, sex, age, hours worked, etc. Conclusion included that females, minorities, and those who work longer hours get paid less.

## Machine Learning from Scratch
Trained a Naive Bayes model and a Logistic Regression model to predict the odds of survival as a crew member on the Titanic. Class, Age, and Sex were significant factors in predicting your chances with an 80% accuracy. See the [code](MLFromScratch/LogisticRegression.pdf) and [documentation](MLFromScratch/ML from Scratch.pdf). Michael Stinnett trained the Naive Bayes model [here](MLFromScratch/NaiveBayes.cpp).
