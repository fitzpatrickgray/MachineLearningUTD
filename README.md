CS 4375 Introduction to Machine Learning

## Data Exploration
Basic statistical information calculation on two different vectros of information. See the [code](DataExploration/DataExploration.cpp), or if you want to see the [documentation](DataExploration/Document.md)

## Linear Models
Trained a linear regression model to fit accelerometer data of a fan. Three different configurations placed two weights on different fan blades, oscillations in X, Y, and Z directions were measured. Model would predict the magnitude of these oscillations given the configuration. See the [code](LinearModels/AccelerometerLinReg.Rmd) and [documentation](LinearModels/LinearRegression.pdf). You can see my partner's work, Michael Stinnett in his [classification documentation](LinearModels/Classification.pdf)
